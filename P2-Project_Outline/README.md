## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Lets breakdown the overview of this project into three different componenets:

1.Why:
These days it is not that easy to get yourself out of your home and rush towards a drink/coffee shop to grab one. It takes time, effort and energy from the individual to get that drink. So, why not make a web app which can make this process alot easier and simple? This scenerio make us think of developing and maintaining a web app to order the drinks/coffee/beverages from the shops nearby and just get it at your door step. 

2.How:
So, we will be able to accomplish the goal of developing this web app by following the best software devlopment approaches, best coding practices and design pattern, and most of the learning we gained from LC-101 cohort. Technologies may include Google-map API, OOP concepts, classes, inheretence and objects. Java will be our core programming language which will be used to write logic. And, MVC design pattern will be used alongwith Spring-boot MVC and JPA/hibernate. Also, we will be using database to store all the data related to this app.

3.What:
We will be making a drink ordering web-app which will simply help a user to order the drink of his choice from the nearby shops/restaurants. A user can sign-up/login, authenticate the acoount, make an order of the drink to his fav shop, checkout and pay the bill. And then withing a short period of time, he will be able to enjoy that drink at his place.


### Features
The following features will be provided by the web-app:
1.User Login Authentication:
User will be required to sign-in into the app through an account, which will be authenticated to make sure the user is authorized.
2.Shops/Bars available nearby and their Menu:
User will be able to see the available shops/bar/restaurants around to choose a shop as well as the menu of items provided by the same shop.
3.Add to Cart:
User will be able to add the items he want to buy of his choice to the cart. He will be displayed all the items added to the cart.
4.Checkout:
User will be able to checkout, pay his bill once finalized the order. The total amount of bill will be displayed to the user.
Include Features here


### Technologies
The following technologies will be used in this project:
Java
Spring Boot
Hibernate
MySql
Google-map API
Thymeleaf Template.


### What I'll Have to Learn
We need to learn how to use google-map API to display the shops/bars nearby into the app for the user to see and select one of them to order the drink.
So, in this initial phase, we don't know how to integrate google-maps with our web-app to display the shops to the users.
